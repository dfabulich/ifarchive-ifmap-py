This is the Interactive Fiction Archive at
[ifarchive.org](/).

You may be interested in...

- The [README file for the Archive](/if-archive/README)
- An [ASCII directory tree map](/if-archive/directory-tree)
- [Master-Index.xml](/indexes/Master-Index.xml), which describes every file in the Archive (very large XML file!) 

The [list of all directories](/indexes/dirlist.html)
is a table of contents of the entire Archive, in order. The
[list of files, sorted by date](/indexes/date.html)
is a (long) index of every file. You can also see the entries of the
[past week](/indexes/date_1.html),
[past month](/indexes/date_2.html),
[past three months](/indexes/date_3.html), or
[past year](/indexes/date_4.html).

Or, go delving into the hierarchical tree shown here.
